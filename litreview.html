			<h1>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web: Social Networking</h1>
            <p>Social media networks are a key part of the everyday lifestyle of people all around the world, with an estimated 1.47 billion users on Facebook every single day (Facebook, n.d.). The vast amounts of data that companies can collect such as Facebook and Google on a daily basis are constantly at risk, susceptible to unauthorised access. Information exposure is usually a plus, even a must, if people want to participate in social communities; however, leakage of personal information, especially one’s identity, may invite malicious attacks from the real world and cyberspace, such as stalking, reputation slander, personalized spamming and phishing (Lam et al. 2008). Such examples of malicious attacks are highly unlikely in common users, however the users should always be aware of such a risk and their consequences of having their data leaked (Irani et al. 2011).</p>
            <p>According to Steijn et al. (2016) “both users of social media networking sites and young people are often less concerned with the privacy of their data than the older generation.” The younger generation is less likely to care about what they are posing on social media, whereas older people are more aware of what they are posting. The addition of extensive security checks on social media platforms has made it increasingly easier to manage what data the company can collect and who can see it. Most companies make it common practice to force users to review their security settings every few months, along with regularly changing their password and making users regularly read their terms and conditions. Along with this, websites must state in their terms and conditions and privacy policies what they do with data they are supplied and if data is likely to be passed on to a third party then the company must explicitly state what will be passed on. </p>
            <p>Self Information Disclosure is defined as telling others previously unknown knowledge so that it becomes shared knowledge (Lam et al., 2008). Information given to social media sites such as your first name and last name, which are often a requirement, can lead attackers to finding out more about users. Attackers are easily able to dig deeper and be able to recreate your personal profile. Furthermore, entire profiles are easily able to be created about users, even with little knowledge of the user. Indeed, personal data lies at the forefront of different business models and constitute an important source of revenue for several online companies, such as Google and its subsidiary DoubleClick, Facebook and Amazon (Marreiros et al. 2017). Targeted adverts are now common use on webpages in an attempt to fully interact with the user, with companies such as Google commonly recording search terms, using cookies and other tracking services to target adverts to a higher extent. While this acts as a great way of revenue, as the user gets adverts that they want to see, users tend to be wary of how companies use their data.</p>
            <p>Information collected by social media sites can be used for social engineering and the involuntary exposure of personal information. Social engineering occurs perhaps most directly on websites where malware and phishing programs are able to induce internet browsers and users into places where security is less available or effective (Mansour, 2016). Users will be induced by colourful looking adverts and articles which lead them away from the main website onto a site that has fewer security measures. Companies are combating the use of fake adverts that draw users away from their platforms. Most social-engineering types of viruses are found on social networking sites (Mansour, 2016), which makes them extremely hard to show up on anti-virus softwares, however some of the most powerful software are now able to pick up malware specifically targeted at social media networks.</p>
            <p>Sharing personal information with companies poses both great advantages and disadvantages, with the advantages most often outweighing the disadvantages. This is shown purely in the sheer number of users on social networking sites. Publications from Facebook show that there were 2.23 billion users using the social network site in July 2018 (Facebook, n.d.), which is near 30% of the world’s population. This number is constantly rising as less economically developed countries gain consistent, reliable access to the internet.</p>
            <p>Enhancing privacy settings is a key strategies in mitigating privacy risks in the social networks (Mansour, 2016). Ensuring that privacy settings are up to date and using advanced authentication systems, such as biometric authentication, to login to accounts can drastically reduce the risk of data leakage on social networks. The need for personal security of social networks will also be a requirement and will need to constantly adapt in an ever changing world, where the risk of data leakage is constantly changing. Although the advanced authentication systems are in place, it is up to the end users whether they want to enable them or not.</p>
            <p>I believe that personal information will always be subject to an increasing risk of data leakage from social media networks. As explained in the review, the large number of users using such social media sites is increasing at high rates, and the data that they are collecting is higher than ever. Personal information should always be kept personal, however with the use of social media networks, more people are putting themself at a higher risk of exposure. With the recent developments in biometric authentication methods, such as facial recognition and fingerprint recognition, account security is as secure as it has ever been. There are always ways users can help mitigate their personal information, but it is their willingness to do so that is the greatest impact.</p>
